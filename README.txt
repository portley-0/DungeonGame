I implemented some code from the "Collision Block" Section of this video
in order to create the collision blocks for my game map. I used the Tiled 
map editor to create a game map, and then parsed the collision block layer
data so that i can iterate through the rows and values, creating collision 
blocks in the right locations.

I used the method demonstrated in this video to animate the sprite
sheets within my game.
